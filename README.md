# grooming
Analysis of grooming kinematics in *Drosophila melanogaster*

The contents of each script or notebook is briefly described below. Note that many of the scripts are dependent on functions within ```grooming_functions.ipynb```.

## dimensionality reduction analysis 

* dim_red_continuous.ipynb: 
* dim_red_discrete.ipynb: Takes the files generated by ```merge_features.ipynb``` and runs PCA, UMAP, and t-SNE on grooming bouts. Colors each point in the 2d embeddings according to the discrete qualitative grooming labels (height, concentration, synchronicity, left/right bias, etc) I made from watching grooming videos.
* merge_features.ipynb: Combines grooming angles 3d coordinates from wild type flies to qualitative grooming observations that I made from watching grooming videos (height, concentration, synchronicity, left/right bias, etc)
* pca_umap_tsne.ipynb:
* umap_t1_grooming.ipynb:


## dynamic mode decomposition (DMD)

* dmd_grooming.ipynb: Contains functions for performing DMD on a single grooming bout and tests DMD on a couple examples.
* dmd_parameter_tuning.ipynb: Contains functions for performing DMD on a single grooming bout and explores the effect of the number of stacks, number of strides, and SVD rank on the ability of DMD to predict a single grooming bout.
* pydmd_grooming.ipynb: Uses PyDMD to determine the DMD modes and reconstruct a single grooming bout. Also fits DMD on multiple bouts from a single fly except for one, then tries to predict the remainder of the grooming sequence of the bout that was left out. 

## general quantifications

* coordinates.ipynb: Creates a 3d plot for each grooming bout showing the joint trajectories of T1. Helpful for visualizing the range of motion during grooming.

## processing

* combine_grooming_bouts: 
* grooming_functions.ipynb:
