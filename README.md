# grooming
Analysis of grooming kinematics in Drosophila melanogaster

## dimensionality reduction analysis 


## dynamic mode decomposition (DMD)

* dmd_grooming.ipynb : 
* dmd_parameter_tuning.ipynb : 
* pydmd_grooming.ipynb : Uses PyDMD to determine the DMD modes and reconstruct a single grooming bout. Also fits DMD on multiple bouts from a single fly except for one, then tries to predict the remainder of the grooming sequence of the bout that was left out. 

## general quantifications
